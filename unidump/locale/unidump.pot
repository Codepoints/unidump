"Think of it as hexdump(1) for Unicode. The command analyses the input and "
"then prints three columns: the raw byte index of the first code point in "
"this row, code points in their hex notation, and finally the raw input "
"characters with control and whitespace replaced by a dot."

"Invalid byte sequences are represented with an “X” and with the hex value "
